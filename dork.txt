1 - complete the grid 
2 - make the player section code 
3 - work on movement




for tokens we can make a struct 
    it will have a current psoiton which store the (x , y)
    and a 


struct name_and_pos{
    int x , y;
    char* name
}

struct tooken
{
    name_and_pos *instance;
    char*color
}


movement logic


MOVEMENT AT THE START OF THE GAME:
    we have the (x , y) values of the start postion
    all we have to see in which direction we have to move from the start postion ( ← ↑ → )
                                                                                     ↓
    we can put constion to make sure it moves according to teh color like if red move up
    if blue move right from start position 


WHAT IF THERE IS A BREAK POINT AND WE HAVE TO GO ( ← ↑ → )
                                                     ↓

we can break point on the winner section like if (8 , 6) -> move right and start a counter and store the direction in a struct or linked list 
after that if the counter hit the value 6 check the postion stored if it is left it will move right after the breakpoint
